			<h4>The Socratic Method and 6 Other Awesome Coaching Strategies</h4>
			<p class="sub-header">
				1. Indirect Praise.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				It's easy to think that excessive direct praise like, “wow, you did an amazing job” or “you are so good at this” will increase student outcomes. The opposite is true.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				These type of value judgements transform a coaching session into a time of evaluation and over time students become insensitive to the praise. Instead, provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the students suﬀicient tackling of the problem. The student will deduce the praise themselves! Save direct positive feedback for those really, really special times. 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				2. Indirect Negative Feedback.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Avoid ever explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keeping working backwards until they are able to self correct.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				3. Scaffolding Questions
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				There are diﬀerent levels of questions. Lower level questions are easier and have clear, right or wrong answers. Higher level questions are harder and involve application of a variety of concepts within a real world setting. The “Scaﬀolding Questions” technique uses low level questions to build up to higher level questions. Don’t fall into the traps of (1) preserving student self esteem by dumbing down your questions and never challenging them or (2) or starting oﬀ with high level questions before you lay the scaﬀolding they need to reach an answer. Instead, start oﬀ with simple, low level, questions and build up from there.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				4. Code Tour.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Many students can make something that works without 
				understanding why it works. Asking them to “walk through” the code, explaining what each line does, lets them recognize the “why” behind each action.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				5. Teach the Teacher.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Teaching is sometimes the best way to learn. Have the student teach you a concept that they learned the prior week. This will be great reinforcement and will uncover learning gaps.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				6. Awesome Analogies.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and fields, the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it! 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				7. Socratic Method.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				The Socratic Method is a combination of all of the strategies above. The oﬀicial definition is, “A pedagogical technique in which a teacher does not give information directly but instead asks a series of questions, with the result that the student comes either to the desired knowledge by answering the questions or to a deeper awareness of the limits of knowledge.” A mentor accomplishes this by integrating all of the techniques above to achieve a clear learning goal.
