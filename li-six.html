				My student wants to skip this session.

				Before anything else, use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors become more essential for students. You can ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared or lure them by sharing information that requires no preparation (like introducing developer tools). Whatever you do, make that meeting happen. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				When you do have the meeting, simply follow your routine. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				More broadly, begin to engrain in your student that your sole existence is to help them get out of tough situations. Don’t let them run away from hard parts of the curriculum — the benefits of learning to program is totally worth it. If they claim that the issue is external and that they are too busy, remind them of your belief in them. This may be the time to break the rules and provide strong, DIRECT feedback.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				My student didn't do any work this week. At all.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Use scaﬀolding and the Socratic Method to work with student on their current spot in the course. There will be times where you may have to teach a concept explicitly. 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				I haven't seen my student for 2 weeks.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				If you just can’t connect with a student and they miss two consecutive meetings with you, let us know as soon as possible. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better oﬀer support them and remind them of their commitment and goals. 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Hmmm. It depends.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				From our experience, the course material is foundational for building other skills oﬀ. The concepts that students o"en want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content to excel at. Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong enough grasp of the fundamental concepts to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.
