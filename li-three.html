			<h4>8 Tips on How to Have a Baddass First Mentor Session</h4>
			<p class="main-content">
				Below are 8 tips on how to build an incredible first impression that will inspire students.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				1. Skip the small talk.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Just do it. It's awkward, wastes time, and doesn't accomplish much. Later, we'll share better rapport building strategies.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				2. Follow the 66.667% Rule.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				About 2/3rds, 20 minutes of the 30 minute session, or 66.667% of the session should consist of the student speaking. This keeps 
				the students engaged, and gives you the opportunity to show you care about her goals. This foundation of care is essential to build the rapport necessary for true learning (and much better strategy than “small talk”). To keep meaningful conversation going, have core questions and clarifying questions prepared. 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				3. Be a Mickey Goldmill.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				There’s nothing wrong with being nice, but sometimes “being nice” is simply a form of selfish hopelessness. You may know EXACTLY what a student needs to do to reach their potential. Maybe its a stern conversation about devoting more time or about following through with feedback. But that conversation is 4 tricky -- it’s hard. Its easier to give up hope and just be polite. This isn’t good mentorship. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Learning is a struggle, don’t take the easy way out. Be a Mickey Goldmill -- bold and direct, full of hope, and relentlessly coaching until a student reaches their full potential.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				4. Understand their secret dreams.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Our students aren’t learning to program for the hell of it -- they’re learning because it enables a dream. They want to work for 
				themselves, have more time to travel, work at an ambitious startup, or simply make more money. Whatever the dream is, you want to know it. Use your Jedi question-asking skills to draw this information out, and be excited about her dream. Supporting your student will have a huge, positive impact on her learning if the student follows up with committed skill building
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				5. Work with students to break their "dream" down to measurable, specific "objectives".
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				It’s not clear how to start achieving a huge dream like “finding a job at a startup”. Before landing a job you need to demonstrate certain skills. Those skills are made up of sub-skills and objectives. Help your student create a clear, measurable path to achieving her dream. In this phase, its essential that you share how her work with Thinkful fits within the journey to achieving her dream. More o"en than not, Thinkful is an early step towards building the foundational skills she needs to navigate the path on her own.

			<p class="sub-header">
				6. Set high, but necessary expectations.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				No matter how motivated she is, how much she pays, or what courses she’s signed up for, your student will not be able to achieve her goals unless she creates the conditions for rigorous learning. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Here are a few tips to emphasize:
			</p>
			<ul class="indented-section">
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You (the student) need to honestly invest enough time.</span> 12 hours a week is our minimum. If you can’t invest 12 hours each week, you may find yourself quickly unsatisfied with your progress.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Block time oﬀ in your calendar immediately.</span>  Shift things around, speak to family and friends and set the expectation with them that you are going to be committed to learning for the next 3 months.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find a consistent learning environment that works for you. </span> It may be a coffe shop or the kitchen table. Have it be consistent and free of inhibiting distractions.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">See if a friend is willing to learn with you.</span> Having an 	accountability partner will greatly enhance the chances of you learning this stuff. We offer an incentive for this as well.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attend Office Hours. </span> In supplement to your mentor session, you can connect with mentors during the several additional open office hours offered each week.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engage your Google+ 		community.</span> Getting fast feedback onprojects is critical. Read through and critique other students' code. Understanding a codebase someone else wrote is a valuable skill.
				</li>
				<li type=disc class="main-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Each week, no matter what, fill our your RECAP form.</span> It's a small commitment, but sharing your weekly progress, work, and goals with your mentor every week has huge payoffs.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="sub-header">
				7. Routine and Procedure are your best friends.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Set routines and procedures from day 1.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				It would be GREAT if we had all the time in the world to create mind-blowingly fun mentor session plans for each of our students. The reality is that most of us have little to no time to prepare for each session. Instead, we rely on our accumulated experience to get us through. 
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				Routine remedies this! By having an established procedure for running the mentor session, your student engages with a high quality session every single time without you thinking much about it. Make sure to firmly set routines into motion from the first session. 
			</p>
			<p class="sub-header">
				8. Be short and sweet when talking about yourself. If possible, show, don't tell.
			</p>
			<p class="main-content">
				You only need two sentences to introduce your background. You’d be surprised how quickly students will pick it up from there with questions. If available, share your Linkedin profile, GitHub account, or online portfolio.
